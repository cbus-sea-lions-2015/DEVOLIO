We love Open Source!

## We love code reviews
Probably the best way we could benefit from contributions on this project is from code reviews. As students, we are still learning and would love, love, love instructive, specific feedback on any part of the code base. 

## Rules for Pull Requests
1. Do not submit a PR with failing tests
  2. run ```bundle exec rspec``` locally **before** submitting your pull request
  3. make sure your sh*t passes!
